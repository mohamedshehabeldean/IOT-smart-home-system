## Project Overview:
In this project, we developed a comprehensive smart home system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance daily living experiences, increase security, and improve comfort at home. The goal of the project is to create a smart home environment that can interact with us and automatically control household devices in a secure and efficient manner.

## Project Features:

### 1- Abnormal Behavior Detection:

The system includes a camera that uses computer vision techniques and the YOLO model to detect unusual behavior. For instance, if a mother leaves her children alone at home, the model can recognize if there is a fight or any harmful behavior and send a notification to the mother. It can also detect fires and other emergencies.

### 2- Automated Door Control:

The door opens automatically when a person approaches the camera. If the person is authorized, the door will open; if not, it remains closed.

### 3- Intruder Alert:

When the house is empty, a PIR sensor is activated. This sensor detects motion and sends an immediate alert if an intruder enters the house.

### 4- Temperature and Humidity Control:

A sensor measures the roomâ€™s temperature and humidity. If the temperature is too high, the fan turns on automatically.
Automatic Lighting:

The camera detects if someone is at home, and the lights turn on automatically.

### 5- LCD Display:

An LCD screen displays real-time values of temperature and other relevant data.

### 6- Energy Saving:

A sensor measures the amount of light. If the light level is low, it turns on the outdoor garden lights to avoid them being on continuously.

### 7- Gas Leak Detection:

A sensor measures the gas level. In case of any gas leak in the apartment, it alerts early to prevent hazards.
